              <p>
                <strong>How do I open an account?</strong> Continental relationships begin with a
                sponsored introduction or a request through the Private Client Office. After your
                application is submitted, a relationship manager will contact you to coordinate
                identification and source-of-wealth documentation.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How long does approval take?</strong> Typically one business day for
                qualifying applications. Complex relationships involving multiple jurisdictions
                or beneficial owners may require additional review.
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong>Why three currencies?</strong> Continental clients hold USD, EUR, and GBP
                positions independently. Each portfolio is reconciled separately. Consolidated
                figures shown on your dashboard are computed at the EOM Geneva fix for reporting
                convenience only.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How are interest credits calculated?</strong> Interest is accrued daily
                against the prevailing rate for each currency band and credited monthly on the
                first business day.

              <p>
                <strong>How long does a withdrawal take?</strong> Approved withdrawals settle
                within one business day for SEPA, UK Faster Payments, Wise, Revolut, and PayPal.
                Bank wire to non-correspondent institutions may take two to three business days
                depending on the receiving bank.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Why does the amount sit in pending balance first?</strong> Funds move
                from available to pending balance when an instruction is received. They settle
                fully (and are removed from pending) once your banker has executed and confirmed.

              <p>
                <strong>Why does a destination need approval?</strong> Continental only routes
                outbound funds to destinations a finance officer has verified against your KYC
                file. This protects you from misdirection by impersonators.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>How long does approval take?</strong> Typically within the business day.
                Domestic SEPA and UK Faster Payments are usually faster than international
                wires, which may require a confirmation call to the receiving institution.

                <strong>Where do I find my statements?</strong> The Document Vault on your
                dashboard contains every statement, account letter, KYC confirmation, withdrawal
                receipt, refund evidence, and annual tax summary issued in your name.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Can I request a custom report?</strong> Yes. Open a thread in the Secure
                Message Center and your banker will prepare it within the business day.

                The Secure Message Center is the fastest way to reach your private banker for any
                non-urgent matter. For urgent operational issues — a suspected unauthorised
                instruction or a freeze request — call the Private Client Office directly on the
                number you have on file.
