                All client data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3 and at rest using AES-256.
                Client files held in Geneva are stored on hardware kept within Swiss federal
                jurisdiction and subject to physical access logging.

                Continental never auto-settles outbound funds. Every withdrawal is reviewed by a
                named officer against the client's mandate parameters before settlement. Above the
                dual-approval threshold a second officer must co-sign.

                Withdrawal destinations are only valid once approved against the client's KYC
                file. New beneficiaries trigger an explicit verification with the receiving
                institution.

              <p>
                Every officer action against a client account writes an immutable record to the
                bank's audit ledger — actor, timestamp, prior state, new state, IP address, and
                free-text justification. Audit rows cannot be amended or deleted by any role.

              <p>
                Balance changes are mirrored into a separate immutable ledger that retains the
                before/after balance, the responsible officer, and the cited reason. Reconciliations
                are performed quarterly and on demand.
